My name is Luiggy Augusto Lima Alves, an 18-year-old Computer Science undergraduate at the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), originally from Amazonas, Brazil. I am deeply passionate about technology and innovation, with a strong interest in programming and building solutions that positively impact people and the community.

My goal is to become a well-rounded professional, combining solid technical skills with strong soft skills to adapt to technological advancements and effectively solve complex challenges.
